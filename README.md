# Healthy-Savings API

Healthy-Savings is a cloud-enabled fitness app that incentivises a healthy lifestyle by increasing the interest rate on the users savings account.

Healthy-Savings uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Fitbit API] - Fitness tracking information from Fitbit wearable devices!
* [Google Fit API] - Fitness tracking information from Google services.
* [Capital One Hackathon API] - API for finanacial data.
* [Java Spring] - Spring helps development teams everywhere build simple, portable,  fast and flexible JVM-based systems and applications.
